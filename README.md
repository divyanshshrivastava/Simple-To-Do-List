# To-Do-List
This is a simple to do list that i created using HTML,CSS and javaScript.
You can add and remove tasks from it.
This model uses the localStorage feature which can retain your tasks even after the website is refreshed or the session is ended.

This is still a work in progress, I am currently adding a "Themes" option to it to make it look more better.
